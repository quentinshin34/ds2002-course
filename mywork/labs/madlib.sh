echo "There was once a $ADJ1 $NOUN1 named $NAME1. $NAME1 would often $ADV1 $VERB1 and was famous for it.
One day $NAME1 decided to $VERB2 with another $NOUN1. All of sudden a $NOUN2 joined them and
even though they were not invited to $VERB2. $NAME1 was pleasntly surprised and thought that $NOUN2 was very $ADJ2 and $ADJ3
and enjoyed hanging out."
